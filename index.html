<h1>Green Technology in Honduras</h1>
<h2>Green paradise project</h2>
 <p>This initiative, launched in 2023 in Olancho, El Paraiso, seeks to promote a decarbonized economy by adapting agricultural production to climate change. 
  It focuses on agroecological practices and climate-smart technologies in the cocoa, coffee, livestock and forestry value chains.

<h2>Biofences in the motagua river</h2>
<p>Biofences are artisanal floating barriers designed to retain floating debris and prevent pollution of rivers and seas. Initially implemented in Guatemala, its success has led to its adoption in Honduras, especially in the Motagua River,
 where they help stop the accumulation of waste and protect aquatic ecosystems.</p>

<h2>Use of efficient machinery in the textile industry</h2>
<p>Honduran textile companies, such as Elcatex and San Juan Textiles, have adopted efficient machinery to reduce energy and water consumption per unit produced. In 2022, IDB Invest provided financing of $40 million to support these initiatives, 
demonstrating that sustainability and profitability can go hand in hand in the textile industry.</p>
